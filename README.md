## ⚙️ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

  - Node.js & npm
  - Python & pip
  - MongoDB instance (local or cloud)
  - Tesseract OCR

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/MandarKelkarOfficial/talent-sync.git
    cd talent-sync
    ```

2.  **Frontend & Node.js Backend Setup**

      - Install dependencies from `package.json`:
        ```sh
        npm install
        ```
      - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables:
        ```env
        MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
        JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
        GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key
        PORT=your_email_port
        EMAIL_USER=your_email_user
        EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password
        AES_KEY_BASE64=######
        HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=#########
        ```

3.  **Python Backend Setup**

      - Navigate to the Python backend directory:
        ```sh
        cd backend
        ```
      - Create Virtual Environment and activate it:
        ```sh
        python -m virtualenv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
      - Install the required Python packages from `requirements.txt`:
        ```sh
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
      - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory for Python-specific variables if needed.

### Running the Application

  - Use the `dev` script to run both the frontend and the Node.js server concurrently:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
  - Start the Python FastAPI server from the `backend` directory:
    ```sh
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload
    ```

Your application should now be running locally\!
